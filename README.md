# Stord

Stord is a self hosted media management tool for your self-hosted cloud. It allows
you to manage your backed up media files seamlessly across all devices. Although the project
was initially inspired by need for an aesthetic way to manage my media on my personal server,
feel free to host this on AWS and you got yourself a fully provisioned cloud media manager.
